            What Makes It Different From Other Warranties
          </h3>

          </p>
          <p class="font-semibold">
            They only cover materials, and they only work if the contractor stays in business.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Golden Pledge® Warranty is different because:

              </p>
              <p class="mt-2">
                This is the biggest advantage. With most contractors' warranties, if that contractor closes their doors, sells the business, or simply refuses to honor the warranty… the homeowner is left without recourse.
