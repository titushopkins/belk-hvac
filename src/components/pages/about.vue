              <div>
                Jay Lott Roofing was founded in <span class="font-semibold">1986 by Hershel “Jay” Lott</span> and his wife, <span class="font-semibold">Gladys,</span> with a simple
                but powerful goal: do honest work, use quality materials, and treat people the right way.
              </div>

              <div>
                As a <span class="font-semibold">born-again believer,</span> Mr. Jay Lott built his company on biblical principles of
                <span class="font-semibold">integrity, hard work, and accountability.</span> From the very beginning, he believed that if you tell the truth, stand behind your
                work, and take care of your customers, success will follow. That belief became the foundation of how Jay Lott Roofing operates—and it
                still guides the company today.
              </div>

              <div>
                Through decades of dedication, consistency, and craftsmanship, Mr. Lott earned a reputation as one of the
                <span class="font-semibold">most trusted and respected roofers in Jasper, Woodville, and the surrounding East Texas counties.</span> Homeowners know that when Jay
                Lott Roofing is on the job, the work will be done right the first time, with no shortcuts and no surprises.
              </div>

              <div>
                Outside of roofing, Mr. Lott lives the same values he works by. He prefers a <span class="font-semibold">simple, honest way of life,</span> spending his spare
                time <span class="font-semibold">bow hunting and training mules,</span> pursuits that reflect patience, discipline, and respect for tradition—much like the way
                he has run his business for nearly four decades.
              </div>

              <div>
                Today, Jay Lott Roofing continues to carry forward the legacy that Jay and Gladys started:
                <span class="font-semibold">faith-driven values, quality workmanship, and treating every customer like family.</span>

              A New Chapter Built on the Same Foundation

            <div class="text-base text-white leading-6 space-y-4">
              <div>
                At the beginning of <span class="font-semibold">2025, Jay Lott Roofing</span> merged with <span class="font-semibold">Deep East Texas Roofing,</span> a company
                founded and owned by <span class="font-semibold">Justin Schlichter.</span> This merger brought together two trusted East Texas roofing companies that share the
                same core values: <span class="font-semibold">faith, integrity, hard work, and doing what’s right for the customer.</span>
              </div>

              <div>
                Justin Schlichter started his roofing career long before owning a company. <span class="font-semibold">He grew up around construction and real estate,</span>
                gaining hands-on exposure to how quality work and honest business are done. Wanting a deeper understanding of homes from the inside out,
                Justin went to school to earn his <span class="font-semibold">Professional Home Inspector license,</span> then went on to work as a
                <span class="font-semibold">Project Manager for a custom home builder in Houston,</span> where attention to detail and high standards were non-negotiable.
              </div>

              <div>
                In <span class="font-semibold">2015,</span> Justin founded <span class="font-semibold">Deep East Texas Roofing & Construction, LLC in Lufkin, Texas,</span> with a
                focus on quality craftsmanship, clear communication, and long-term customer relationships. Like Mr. Jay Lott, Justin is
                <span class="font-semibold">a man of faith</span>who believes that strong Christian values and a solid work ethic should guide every decision—on and off the roof.
              </div>

              <div>
                The merger of these two companies strengthened operations, expanded resources, and positioned the business for continued growth—while
                staying true to the principles that built its reputation. It has also allowed <span class="font-semibold">Mr. Jay Lott to step more fully into a leadership and mentorship role,</span> passing down decades of experience to the next generation.
              </div>

              <div>
                <span class="font-semibold">That said, Jay hasn’t gone anywhere.</span> He can still be found dropping in on job sites, checking on crews, and making sure the work
                meets the standard his name was built on.
              </div>

              <div>
                Together, this partnership represents the best of both worlds:
                <span class="font-semibold">decades of trusted craftsmanship combined with modern systems, expanded capabilities, and a shared commitment to serving East Texas with excellence.</span>
              </div>

                By combining the decades-long experience and integrity of <span class="font-semibold">Jay Lott Roofing</span> with the systems, growth, and modern expertise of
