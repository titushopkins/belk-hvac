          Why Metal Roofing Is a Smart Investment in Texas
        </h2>

        <p>
          A metal roof isn’t just a roofing choice—it’s a long-term investment in your home. While the upfront cost is higher than traditional shingles, metal roofing consistently pays homeowners back over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Metal roofs are built to last significantly longer than asphalt shingles, often two to three times as long when properly installed. They stand up better to Texas heat, high winds, hail, and intense sun exposure without breaking down or losing integrity. Metal also reflects heat more efficiently, which can help reduce attic temperatures and improve overall energy efficiency.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond performance, metal roofing adds real curb appeal and value. Its clean lines, modern appearance, and durability make it attractive to homeowners and buyers alike. When you factor in longevity, reduced maintenance, and strong warranties, metal roofing becomes one of the smartest roofing investments available.

          Galvalume vs. Painted Metal: Understanding the Difference
        </h3>

        <p>
          Not all metal roofs are the same. Two of the most common options homeowners choose are <span class="font-semibold">Galvalume</span> and <span class="font-semibold">painted metal,</span> and each has its own advantages.
        </p>

        <div class="rounded-b-2xl p-6 bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-white shadow-lg p-6 space-y-4">

            Galvalume (Unpainted)
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Galvalume metal</span> is coated with a blend of aluminum and zinc, which provides exceptional corrosion resistance and durability. It has a natural metallic finish and is often chosen for its strength, longevity, and lower cost compared to painted options. Galvalume is a great choice for homeowners who prioritize performance and a more industrial or classic metal look.
          </p>

          <h4 class="font-bold text-white text-lg">
            Painted Metal
          </h4>
          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Painted metal,</span> on the other hand, starts with the same Galvalume base but adds a high-quality factory-applied paint system. This allows homeowners to choose from a wide range of colors while adding an additional layer of protection against the elements. Painted metal is ideal for those who want the benefits of metal roofing with enhanced aesthetics and color coordination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both options perform exceptionally well when installed correctly—the right choice often comes down to appearance, budget, and long-term goals for the home.

        <p>
          One of the biggest benefits of choosing <span class="font-semibold">Mueller metal roofing</span> is the strong warranty coverage that comes with it — not just talk, but real years of protection you can count on.

          <p>
            <span class="font-semibold">Mueller’s Galvalume® panels</span> — the strong, corrosion-resistant metal used on many roofs — come with a <span class="font-semibold">20-year limited warranty</span> against rust-through, structural failure, or perforation under normal atmospheric conditions. This warranty covers material replacement or repair if the metal fails due to corrosion within that period.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Galvalume is not painted, it can naturally weather and vary in appearance over time; uniform color is not guaranteed under this warranty.

            If you choose a painted metal finish (which includes more than 30 designer colors and advanced paint systems), Mueller backs that finish with a 45-year limited paint warranty on its painted panels. The paint warranty protects against peeling, cracking, and excessive fading — giving you long-lasting color and curb appeal.

          Not all metal roofs are the same. The panel style you choose affects appearance, performance, maintenance, and long-term value. At Jay Lott Roofing , we install three primary metal roofing systems, and we make sure homeowners understand the real differences between them.

              R-Panel (Exposed Fastener Metal Roofing)
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2">
              R-Panel is a durable, cost-effective metal roofing option commonly used on residential, agricultural, and light commercial buildings. These panels are installed with exposed screws that fasten directly through the face of the panel into the decking or framing.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              R-Panel is manufactured from 26-gauge metal, offering good strength at an affordable price point. When installed properly, it performs well, but it does require ongoing maintenance. Because the fasteners are exposed to sun and weather, the rubber washers on the screws naturally dry out over time.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2 font-semibold">
              On any exposed-fastener metal roof, the screws typically need to be replaced about every 10 years to maintain a watertight seal and prevent leaks.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              R-Panel is a solid option for homeowners who want metal durability at a lower initial cost and are comfortable with periodic maintenance.
            </p>

            <div class="rounded-b-2xl bg-gradient-to-b from-transparent to-white shadow-lg p-10 sm:p-14 shadow-lg">

              Concealed Fastener Panel (Hidden Fastener Metal Roofing)
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Concealed fastener panels are a step up from R-Panel in both appearance and performance. While the fasteners are hidden from view, these panels are still mechanically attached to the roof through a perforated fastening leg along the edge of the panel.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              This design allows the next panel to overlap and cover the fasteners, creating a cleaner look while reducing exposed penetrations. Like R-Panel, concealed fastener panels are typically made from 26-gauge metal, but with improved water management and a more refined finish.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Because the screws are not directly exposed to the elements, concealed fastener roofs generally require less maintenance and last longer than exposed-fastener systems—while still being a more cost-effective option than standing seam.

              Mueller Snap-Lok Standing Seam (Premium Metal Roofing)
            </h3>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Mueller Snap-Lok Standing Seam is the highest-performance metal roofing system we install. Unlike R-Panel or concealed fastener systems, Snap-Lok panels are attached using hidden clips, not screws through the panels themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              These clips allow the panels to move freely as temperatures change, making Snap-Lok a true “floating” panel system. This design prevents common metal roofing issues like wrinkling, fastener fatigue, and oil canning over time.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Snap-Lok standing seam panels are made from heavier 24-gauge metal, providing superior strength, rigidity, and long-term performance. With no exposed fasteners, there are no screws to replace and minimal maintenance required over the life of the roof.
            </p>
            <p class="mt-2">
              This system offers the cleanest appearance, the best durability, and the longest lifespan—making it the ideal choice for homeowners who want a premium, worry-free metal roof.

                    <p>
                      With R-Panel installations, it is acceptable to install over one existing layer of shingles. In these cases, we install 1×4 lathing to create a proper fastening surface and allow airflow beneath the panels.

                    <p>
                      Concealed fastener panels and Snap-Lok systems require a smooth, flat surface. These panels rely on precise engagement, and an uneven surface can cause panels to flex or unsnap when walked on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mt-2">
                      For these systems, we remove the existing shingles and install a high-quality synthetic underlayment to ensure a flat, stable base for proper performance.
